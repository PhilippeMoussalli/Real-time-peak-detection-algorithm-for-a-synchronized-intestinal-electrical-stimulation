# Real-time-peak-detection-algorithm-for-a-synchronized-intestinal-electrical-stimulation
Internship project conducted in collaboration of the University of Michigan. The aim was to implement a real-time algorithm that detects the peaks of the intestinal slow waves. The algorithm is used on an implantable IPG chip for treatment of diabetes and obesity.
